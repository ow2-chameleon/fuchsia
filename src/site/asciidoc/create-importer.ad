As seen in [Fuchsia 101](Fuchsia-101), importers use **import declaration** as input. The information contained in the **import declaration** must be enough in order that the processor execute its role properly.

* className
* endpoint.url

.Output:
* OSGi service registered with a' representing the JAX-WS (Remote service)

*Detailed Description*

Today to import the JAX-WS service Fushsia uses http://cxf.apache.org/[CXF]. CXF is used in order to reduce the complexity in creating the connection and handling with different issues that may be raised.

MQTT importer

.External Requirement:
* MQTT server with a known address 
* EventAdmin service configured in the machine that will receive MQTT event

.Import Declaration information required: 
* id
* mqtt.queue

.Output:
* A message will be published in EventAdmin in the queue _mqtt.queue_, meaning that it will use the same name as the MQTT *queue*

*Detailed Description*

http://mqtt.org/[MQTT] is a protocol http://openiot.eu/[largely diffused] protocol for message exchange due to its good performance. The implementation used by Fuchsia to support MQTT was http://www.rabbitmq.com/[RabbitMQ]

PubSubHubBub importer

.Output:
* A message will be published in EventAdmin in the queue $push.eventAdmin.queue, meaning that it will use the same name of *queue* as PuSH

*Detailed Description*

There are no well known and portable PuSH implementations, Fuchsia implemented partially https://pubsubhubbub.googlecode.com/git/pubsubhubbub-core-0.4.html[PuSH specification]
