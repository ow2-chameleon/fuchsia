<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fuchsia is an extensible tool for integrating external communication protocols inside an OSGi platform. It provides a common interface for creating and managing external connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As most of modern applications require multiple sources of information such as web services, databases or ubiquitous devices. The integration among those different services become a major issue when dealing with multitude of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In ubiquitous applications this kind of integration is even more important since the dynamicity and the multitude of protocol grows with number of devices supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, developers are suddenly facing the challenge of mastering several protocol, and their respective tools for debugging, dependency managing, native calls access, access configuration, etc. That is where Fuchsia plays a key role, by providing the same way of dealing with different protocols, creating a single entry-point for all protocols supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Appsgate all those characteristics are gathered in order to provide an Smart Home environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can administrate and monitor all the exchange of your OSGi platform with externals protocols through an unique control panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">There exist essentially 4 types of entities inside fuchsia that you need to understand before go hands-on the code:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Declaration, it is the metadata that describes a device or a service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovery, responsible for the detection of a device/service, in Fuchsia that means create a <strong>Declaration</strong> and adding it to the OSGi registry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Processors, it represents the task itself, being split in two types <strong>Importer</strong> or <strong>Exporter</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Linkers, connects a declaration to a processor, evaluate the constraints to be respected in order to connect those two.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_declarations">Declarations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Think in <strong>Declaration</strong> as a property file, although that it is not a file, it is an service registered in an OSGi platform, as long as this service is registered with the proper platform, <strong>Fuchsia</strong> will recognize it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Its function is to indicate that a given device/service is available with certain properties, and is the role of an Importer/Exporter (explained later) to receive those information as inputs and create a bridge between the OSGi platform and this device (all by using the properties given by the <strong>Declaration</strong>), allowing other services to access this device without knowing its protocol.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_discoveries">Discoveries</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As seen before, the way that we inform the Fuchsia platform the existence of a device/service is through a declaration <strong>Declaration</strong>, that can be registered manually of course (since its a service registered in OSGi platform with the interface <strong>org.ow2.chameleon.fuchsia.core.declaration.ImportDeclaration</strong>), but this can be done by fuchsia discoveries, that use specialized discovery protocols to extract all the relevant information of a given service/device and publish in OSGi platform a <strong>Declaration</strong> containing all those informations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Available discovery implementations:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Filebased discovery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>mDNS/DNSsd</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>uPnP</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_processors">Processors</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_importers">Importers</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to trigger <strong>importers</strong> to perform their job, they must to receive an <strong>import declaration</strong> which is configuration (think of it as a key value mapping, just like java properties). The <strong>importation declaration</strong> will recognized by <strong>Fuchsia</strong> as long as they are registered in OSGi with the proper Fuchsia interface (for an importer for example must be <strong>org.ow2.chameleon.fuchsia.core.declaration.ImportDeclaration</strong> )</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Available implementations:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>JAX-RS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JAX-WS</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>JSON-RPC</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MQTT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PUbSubHubBub</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protobuffer RPC</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_exporters">Exporters</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Analogue to the <strong>importers</strong>, the <strong>exporters</strong> must to receive a <strong>declaration</strong>, but in this case an <strong>export declaration</strong>. But its role is to provide an external access (by external meaning externally to the OSGi platform) to the services available in the current OSGi platform, for instance by publishing a WS.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_linkers">Linkers</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The existence of a <strong>declaration</strong> and a <strong>processor</strong> is not enough to trigger a connection between them, there has to exist a <strong>linker</strong>. This <em>linker</em> is responsible to check the condition on both sides (processor and declaration) see if they <em>match</em>, and just then establish a connection between them.</p>
